# Web-Automation-Testing - PlayWright with Python Pytest 

Playwright Authentication State Storage

A Python script that uses Playwright to automate browser actions and save authentication state (cookies, localStorage, etc.) to a JSON file. Useful for preserving sessions across tests or automating login workflows.

The files test_app.py, check.py how to automate browser interactions using Playwright and pytest. The test simulates user actions such as navigating through a website, clicking links, filling out forms, and capturing screenshots. The goal is to validate functionality, such as submitting an email and navigating to a confirmation page, while ensuring that the workflow behaves as expected.

The record.py has the code- clicks the "GET STARTED" link, switches between light and dark modes, and records the session video. It then checks if the page redirects correctly to the expected URL.
