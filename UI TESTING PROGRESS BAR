This script automates testing of the progress bar on the "UITesting Playground" website. 
It navigates to the progress bar page, clicks the "Start" button, and continuously checks the progress bar value until it reaches 75%. 
Once the progress is sufficient, it clicks the "Stop" button to stop the progress. 
The script is written using Playwright's sync API for browser interaction.
